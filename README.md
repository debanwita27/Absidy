# Description

**Absidy**, in essence is (rather aims to be) a safety guide to people migrating to/staying over in places they're new to. We plan to crowdsource data about prevalant crimes in different areas of a tow/city to help people avoid renting a place or layovers in shady areas.

Additionally, armed with information about travel and safety related laws, and, nearest hospitals and police stations, we aim to make it a traveller friendly, hassle-free substitute to asking around strangers for information or scrounging through the internet.

**Tech stack**:

 - WAMP (Windows (OS), Apache (web-server), MySQL (database), PHP (language))
 - HTML, CSS
 - JavaScript  
 
 (Google Maps JavaScript API, Google Places API)
